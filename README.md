AreaVolumeCalc.py allows you to calculate the area under the curve of interesting data. No additional scripts needed; this is standalone.

The data takes several different user inputs. Try creating a 3D rotating plot of only the accepted values.

You may have some difficulties closing the figure if you use a lot of plot points on a rotating 3D graph. If you wait a little while and close out, it will
resolve itself.
