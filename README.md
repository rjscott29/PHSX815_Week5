AreaVolumeCalc.py allows you to calculate the area under the curve of interesting data. No additional scripts needed; this is standalone.

The data takes several different user inputs. Try creating a 3D rotating plot of only the accepted values.

You may have some difficulties closing the figure if you use a lot of plot points on a rotating 3D graph. If you wait a little while and close out, it will
resolve itself.

NumIntegrationNew.py calculates numerical integrals using the trapezoidal method and Gaussian quadrature.

I had many hurdles when trying to use the gaussian quadrature method. It is close, but not finished because I could not find where my error was.

I am sorry to say that I did not develop it to be used from the terminal. It will be best to open the file into your favorite script editor and look at the code directly.
